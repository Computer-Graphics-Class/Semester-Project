# Semester-Project

HS Crosswords is a desktop application that serves to educate students in a fun and interactive way through the use of crossword puzzles. The crossword puzzles are based on the subjects taught in the high school 8-4-4 system with a mix of world knowledge. Each level beginning from the first will be a random subject and no two consecutive levels will be of the same subjects. This will keep the player guessing on what subject will be tested on the oncoming level. The player has to complete the previous level before proceeding onto the next level. Coins will be earned on completing a level .This will allow the user to unlock special features such as unlocking new themes for the game and getting hints to some of the questions asked. The target group of the game will be high school students in Kenya undergoing the 8-4-4 system but not limited to them. Anyone else can play the game for fun. This will allow them to have a more interactive way of revising on topics and subjects already learned in school without feeling like it is doing school work. It will also allow them to master concepts already learned in school.
